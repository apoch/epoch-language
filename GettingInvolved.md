# Getting Involved #
Creating and supporting a modern programming language is a vast undertaking. As such, we welcome anyone who is interested in getting involved with helping the Epoch language grow, take shape, and become stronger.

There are three primary ways you can be involved:
  1. Test and review existing releases
  1. Contribute new source code
  1. Donations


# Who Should I Contact? #
If you are interested in contributing in any way to the Epoch project, please get in touch with Mike Lewis (project lead) at `don.apoch [at] gmail [dot] com`.


## Testing Epoch Releases ##
The most valuable feedback we can get is the direct experience of those who use Epoch on the front lines for real, production-quality software. We strongly encourage anyone using the language to [report issues](http://code.google.com/p/epoch-language/issues/list), request changes or enhancements, and generally comment on development in the Epoch language. This information will help us continue to shape Epoch into a killer tool for building the next generation of software.


## Contributing Source Code ##
Epoch is an open source project. Anyone who notices a bug, thinks of an enhancement, or generally wishes to expand the project is welcome to contribute to the source code. We accept both new code and reviews of existing code; [the source repository](http://code.google.com/p/epoch-language/source/checkout) is the best place to get started.

Please note that we reserve the right to reject submitted patches or additions to the code.


## Donations ##
In order to ensure that Epoch is ready for real-world action with a variety of computers and environments, we need hardware and operating systems for testing purposes. The more hardware and software combinations we can test, the more robust and reliable Epoch will be. In limited circumstances, contributions of cash may also be accepted.

Please note that donations to the Epoch project are _not_ tax deductible at this time. We are actively exploring the possibility of launching a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization to back the Epoch project.


# Wish List #
Furthering the development of Epoch will require many resources, particularly as we spread to new platforms and deliver richer tools. A short overview of items we would currently like to acquire follows. If you are interested in contributing any item from this list, please contact the project staff.
