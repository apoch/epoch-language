The Epoch language project currently has the following dependencies:


Microsoft Platform SDK
----------------------

The latest version should always work.
http://www.microsoft.com/



Boost
-----

Version 1.38.0
http://www.boost.org/



nVidia CUDA SDK
---------------

Version 2.3
http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html

Please note that compiling CUDA code on Windows requires an installed version
of the cl.exe compiler used by Microsoft Visual Studio. Epoch programs which
make use of the CUDA interop libraries will only be compilable with such an
environment available. However, compiled Epoch programs can still be executed
without the CUDA SDK or cl.exe being installed on the target machine.
