# Getting Started #
Welcome to the Epoch language project! Although we currently have a fairly primitive distribution system, just follow these simple steps and you'll be well on your way to writing great software in Epoch.

First you will need to [download](http://code.google.com/p/epoch-language/downloads/list) the latest release of the Epoch language. For detailed installation and usage instructions, please see the [Installation Guide](http://code.google.com/p/epoch-language/wiki/InstallationGuide).


## Working with Epoch code ##
The primary format of Epoch code is the .epoch file, which is plain text. We recommend using a text editor of your choice to modify Epoch code files. Over time, we will be releasing updates to Era, the IDE for Epoch programs, and eventually Era will take over as the preferred means for working with Epoch code.


## Epochtools ##
The SDK includes a command-line utility called Epochtools, which provides the basic compiler, access to the virtual machine, and assorted other functionality. You can run Epochtools.exe from a command prompt at any time to see a brief description of how to use the utility.


# Writing Epoch Programs #
Check out [The Newcomer's Guide to Epoch](http://code.google.com/p/epoch-language/wiki/NewcomersGuide) for a quick introduction to the language and its features; a more in depth analysis can be found in the [Epoch Programming Guide](http://code.google.com/p/epoch-language/wiki/ProgrammingGuide).
