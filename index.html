<p>Every seasoned programmer knows that building great software involves making some compromises. <em>Choosing a programming language doesn't have to be one of them!</em></p>

<p>Epoch is a language designed to be <em>opinionated</em>. It has been built from the ground up to emphasize certain mindsets and approaches to building software systems and applications, at all scales. Make no mistake, Epoch is probably not for everyone - but if you're a like-minded developer, working from a similar frame of reference, we hope it scratches your itch as well as it scratches our own.</p>

<h3>
<a id="where-it-is-today" class="anchor" href="#where-it-is-today" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where It Is Today</h3>

<p>This is a quick snapshot of what the language currently offers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strong, static typing for safety and correctness</li>
<li>Just-in-time compiles to native code for maximum performance</li>
<li>Garbage collection for memory management</li>
<li>Includes prototype editor with syntax highlighting</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="where-things-are-going" class="anchor" href="#where-things-are-going" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where Things Are Going</h3>

<p>There is always room for progress, but these are some of the areas where we feel it is most important for Epoch to grow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Optional garbage collection for both memory and other resources</li>
<li>Deterministic resource management for cases where GC is suboptimal or not desired</li>
<li>Green thread/fiber model with fast message passing infrastructure for massive parallelism</li>
<li>Improved ahead-of-time compiler, including moving to 64-bit platforms</li>
<li>More diverse platform support, predominantly Linux, BSD, and OS X</li>
<li>Full IDE and first-class tool chain for editing, compiling, and debugging Epoch code</li>
</ul>

<p>The Epoch Language Project is currently in the process of migrating from the now-defunct Google Code onto GitHub. We appreciate your patience as we flesh out the resources available on this site as well as continue development of the core language and tools.</p>
