// The Epoch Language Project
// EPOCHCOMPILER Compiler Toolchain
//
// Wrapper class for loading plugins written in Epoch
//
// The goal of plugins is to support a gradual transition towards
// self-hosting for the Epoch compiler. Various components of the
// C++-hosted compiler can be transitioned into Epoch versions as
// implementations become available; the plugin interface acts as
// an interop layer between the C++ code and the Epoch code.
