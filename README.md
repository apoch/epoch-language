# The Epoch Programming Language
In late August of 2018, I decided to effectively fork the Epoch language and begin work on a new implementation of a *similar* but not entirely identical language. I have already written a decent amount about the reasoning behind this choice on [this wiki page](https://github.com/apoch/epoch-language/wiki/Renewal:-Rebooting-the-Compiler-Toolchain). I am thinking of this reboot as a chance to correct a lot of the design baggage that has accrued over the past several years of work on "legacy" Epoch.

It will be a while before I am happy enough with this new language to want to share it much. Please do feel free to grab the code and play around (the wiki page linked above has some guidance for this). It should typically be in a buildable state even if it is not exactly friendly or approachable yet.
