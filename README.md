# The Epoch Programming Language
Welcome to the home of **Epoch**, an opinionated programming language designed to balance speed, control, and productivity.

Epoch places a strong emphasis on certain ways of thinking about programming, at both large and small scales. The decisions behind the language will undoubtedly not please everyone - but if you're a like-minded programmer, we hope Epoch scratches your itch as well as it has scratched our own.
